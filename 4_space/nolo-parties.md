### L1 Monday

Our awesome community helps you with any L1 related questions or simply helps you get started by setting up your L1 wallet. You will learn to take control of your crypto. Not your keys, not your coins.

We have a strong focus on Ethereum but we will regularly showcase other L1 chains and their projects.&#x20;

### Rollup Tuesday

### Gaming Wednesday

Play your favorite play-to-earn games while enjoying a cold brew with your friends.

### Podcast Friday
