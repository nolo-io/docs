# vision

The crypto community is one of the most inclusive and diverse communities out there. However, it does exist almost entirely online. By opening our (real-world) doors to the public, we are inviting people to join who might otherwise have been left out.

We are the hybrid metaverse. Come have a drink with your friends, no matter where they are. Meet people in person and join groups where ever they are.

DeFi and NTFs have been huge drivers for adoption in [2021](https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Geography-of-Cryptocurrency-2021.pdf). Crypto adoption skyrocketed in relative terms; in real numbers, we still have ways to go. NOLO builds on the success of other projects by creating a space for the community and a real-world gallery for the NFT art market.&#x20;

The metaverse is the next big driver for adoption and weâ€˜re only getting started. In the next 18 months brands, companies, services, and everyone else will build out their presence in the metaverse.

If an alumni signs up for noloversity, we mint a dynamic NFT to track their learning state in the noloverse. If alumni complete classes the NFT gets updated and perks are unlocked.
