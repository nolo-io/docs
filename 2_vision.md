# vision

We are the hybrid metaverse. Come have a drink with your friends, no matter where they are. Meet people in person and join groups where ever they are.

The crypto community is one of the most inclusive and diverse communities out there. However, it does exist almost entirely online. By opening our (real-world) doors to the public, we are inviting people to join who might otherwise have been left out.

DeFi and NTFs have been huge drivers for adoption in [2021](https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Geography-of-Cryptocurrency-2021.pdf). Crypto adoption skyrocketed in relative terms; in real numbers, we still have ways to go. NOLO builds on the success of other projects by creating a space for the community and a real-world gallery for the NFT art market.
